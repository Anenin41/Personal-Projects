\subsection{(b).}
\label{subsec: damping}
According to the discussion we had on class, and in combination with the handout on the wave equation, there is no damping when \( \eta = 1 \). Sometimes, and according to the numerics of the problem that we are studying, \( \eta = 0.5 \) might also be a value that suppress damping. However in here this value doesn't work.

The results of this remark are also confirmed by simulations of the program. The figures are omitted here to save space in the presentation.
