\begin{abstract}
	    The Black-Scholes model remains a cornerstone of financial derivatives pricing, but it assumes normality in stock returns, ignoring real-world asymmetries. This report applies a correction to the original model via a combination of the Gram-Charlier expansion and the Method of Moments (MoM). By incorporating skewness and excess kurtosis to the derivative pricing scheme, accuracy is improved, reducing pricing errors and yielding more realistic option valuations compared to the standard Black-Scholes model.
