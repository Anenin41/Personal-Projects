\section{Introduction}
\label{sec: intro}

The Black-Scholes model \cite{black1973pricing} is one of the most widely used mathematical frameworks for pricing European options. By assuming that asset prices follow a geometric Brownian motion, and that asset returns are normally distributed, the model provides a closed-form solution for option valuation. However, real-life market data are asymmetric, in the sense that they often exhibit skewness and excess kurtosis, not assumed by the original model.

The presence of these statistical characteristics means that the Black-Scholes model misprices options. Capitalizing on this feature, this report enhances the pricing scheme by introducing corrections using the Method of Moments and the Gram-Charlier expansion \cite{wallace1958asymptotic}. By incorporating higher order moments to the probability density function, an adjustment is made to the model to account for non-normal market behavior, overall resulting in a more accurate representation of option prices.
