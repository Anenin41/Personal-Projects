# Personal Projects Repository
This repository showcases projects that I have completed, both under the University of Groningen, and in my free time.

## Moments
This folder contains the base files for the *Enhancing Black-Scholes Option Pricing: A Method of Moments Approach* report. The first draft of this work was done under the course of Model Reduction for Partial Differential Equations at the University of Groningen. Following the success that it had on the course, it was then polished and transformed into the draft that it is today.
